Return only a valid JSON object using the following format, and nothing else, no markdown, no explanation, no commentary:


{{
    "detected_fields": [
    {{
        "field": "FIELD_NAME",
        "value": "EXTRACTED_VALUE",
        "source": "Explicit/Inferred",
    }}
    ]
}}

Instructions:
- In addition to detecting **explicit mentions** of sensitive information, you must also attempt to **infer** 
  relevant information based on context, phrasing, or indirect cues, **as long as it clearly matches one of the
  predefined field names**. Inferred data must still be traceable to contextual evidence in the text and must not
  rely on speculation.
- Check all posible fields and ensure they are valid according to the provided list.
- Do not omit valid field matches even if they appear trivial or embedded in longer phrases. Always extract all explicitly matching values, regardless of perceived relevance or repetition.
- The "source" field must be exactly "Explicit" or "Inferred".
- Do not return extra fields, comments, markdown, or explanation.
- Always return a proper JSON object. The response must start immediately with a curly brace and must not include any markdown, backticks, or formatting wrappers.
